        <p>
          <b>Consultant Ecologist | April 2022 – Present<br /></b>I joined the company as part of the spring and summer team, working with data collection on the field for multiple species and habitats, data analyses, reporting assistance, landscape description and handling the results to ours clients.
          <br><br>
          I am currently part of the GIS team undertaking tasks regarding different Scott Cawley’s projects. One of my responsibilities is to deliver the best quality data to our clients. I also give assistance sorting data to surveyors using Qfiel packages, so they can go to the field with up to date information with easy access to their workspace.
          <br><br>
          On the biodiversity side and I working with birds, bats and botanical identification. When on the field or writing a report, I am utilising Fossit classification, Annex habitats descriptions, and I have capabilities of recording species on site for multidisciplinary surveys. o For bat analysis I am currently using Bat Explorer in order to identify species and areas where the call was heard, I am currently the data manager of one of the projects I am involved so I get to analyse data that other surveyors are collecting. Once the analysis is finished an exported file is created to be sent to the project manager.
          <br><br>
          Based on my results the company offered me a full time position where I will be handling a few different projects organising the GIS data and working with internal data management. <br />

        <p>
          While working with MarketStart I had the opportunity to work for the
          Zendesk program. I had under my responsibilities to work directly to
          our clients coming from different countries and different sizes of
          companies. It gave me the ability of talking about their needs in
          first place, but always gaining information to guide them to the best
          product that we could offer as a solution.
          <br><br>
          During my staying at Zendesk I was a top performer for closing deals
          and lead creations quality and as a result, I was frequently leading
          calibrations between our department in order to grow knowledge
          together.

        <p>
          As a student support team member I had the opportunity to create and
          implement a complete and rich calendar with extracurricular activities
          for Immigrant English Students which helped hundreds of people improve
          their language skills.
          <br><br>
          Under my responsibilities I organised welcoming classes where
          students were able to learn and practice everything they were learning
          in their English schools. Within the extracurricular calendar we were
          giving workshops, English extra classes, walking tours and
          conversations meetings.
          <br><br>
          In order to show results from this action I had to produce reports
          for each quarter of the year, as well presenting the calendar plan for
          the next quarter.

          <b>Co-Founder | October 2017 – June 2018 <br /></b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in 2016 by Anita Valente da Costa and Camilla Eboli Casella, Bauhinia was born as a consultancy company that provides environmental solutions for multiple companies. The main services provided were: 
          <br><br>
          Delimitation of small and large areas using GIS software and landscape analysis. 
          <br />
          Slashed payroll/benefits administration costs and tourism by negotiating pricing to visit the plantations and forests while ensuring the continuation of the environmental services and growth of the farms. 
          <br />
          Helped a large number of small farmers to learn basic concepts of economic organisation, given enough knowledge to work alone after my consultancy.

          Since 2021 Bauhinia has become an NGO initiative that helps small farmers, from the suburb of São Paulo, grow together as a community and I have the pleasure to be part of the fiscal committee revising expenses and following up on projects.To get know more click <a href="https://www.bauhinia.com.br/" target="_blank">here</a> and check my other voluteerings roles.
